  abstract = {This paper introduces web-server monitoring, explaining its importance and describing various monitoring concepts and types. A set of reasons of web-server monitoring are enumerated. Then, in a monitoring strategy, various types of monitor are presented along with a comparison between deep and shallow monitors. Monitoring process meaning and elements are described, revealing that the monitoring process is largely dictated by the monitoring software package in use. A comparison between internal and external monitoring methods, benefits and limitations of each of them, is done. The managing problems are discussed, and the importance of maintain highest possible website uptime and availability is revealed. Finally, we argue that an immediate notification of problems will significantly increase the chance that the problem can be fixed without affecting customers or users.},
